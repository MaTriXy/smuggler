# Smuggler
Makes your data classes Parcelable. Just add `AutoParceable` to the class declaration. That's all. No methods need to be implemented.

```kotlin
data class User(
  val firstName: String,
  val userName: String
) : AutoParcelable

data class Message(
  val text: String,
  val user: User
) : AutoParcelable

data class Chat(
  val title: String,
  val messages: List<Message>,
  val participants: List<User>
) : AutoParcelable
```

# Project Setup
### Add JCenter Repository
Make sure you have `jcenter()` repository in your root `build.gradle`:
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    ...
    jcenter()
  }
}

allprojects {
  buildscript {
    repositories {
      ...
      jcenter()
    }
  }

  repositories {
    ...
    jcenter()
  }
}
```
### Add Smuggler plugin
```gradle
buildscript {
  dependencies {
  	classpath "com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.5.0"
    classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.0.0"
    classpath "io.mironov.smuggler:smuggler-plugin:0.10.0"
  }
}
```
**Important note #1**: Only android gradle plugin 1.5.0 and up is supported.

**Important note #2:** In case you are using android gradle plugin 2.0.0, you have to use an experimental version of smuggler plugin: `io.mironov.smuggler:smuggler-plugin-experimental:0.10.0`

**Important note #3**: In case you have a mutli-module project and want to use `AutoParceable`, you have to add `smuggler-plugin` to each module.
### Apply Smuggler plugin
```gradle
apply plugin: "com.android.application"
apply plugin: "io.mironov.smuggler"
```
**Important note #1**: Smuggler plugin must be applied **after** android plugin.

**Improtant note #2**: Experimental plugin has the same id, so you don't need to add `-experimental` suffix.
